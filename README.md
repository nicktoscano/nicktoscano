Hello!

I am a machine learning engineer.  I currently work with Oracle. 

I have had several positions in my career.  I have been a military intelligence officer, an operations manager for a federal contracting company, a national intelligence analyst, a data scientist, and an account manager.  I am now an solutions engineer working on machine learning projects.

I enjoy learning about and practicing machine learning.  I also have a passion for spatial analysis and financial analysis.
