Hello!

I am a machine learning engineer.  I currently work with Oracle. 

I have had several positions in my career.  I have been a military intelligence officer, an operations manager for a federal contracting company, a national intelligence analyst, a data scientist, and an account manager.  I am now an solutions engineer working on machine learning projects.

I enjoy learning about and practicing machine learning.  I also have a passion for spatial analysis and financial analysis.

You may notice my profile pic is a bard.  The bard is my favorite character class.  In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my dogs and wrapping myself in fantasy worlds of DnD and the likes.  I enjoy reading, playing, and watching DnD and othe role playing games.
