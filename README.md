Welcome!

I am a machine learning engineer.  I currently work with Oracle. 

I have had several positions in my career.  I have been a military intelligence officer, an operations manager for a federal contracting company, a national intelligence analyst, a data scientist, and an account manager.  I am now a solutions engineer working on machine learning projects.

I enjoy learning about and practicing machine learning.  I also have a passion for spatial analysis and financial analysis.

I enjoy spending time with my dogs and wrapping myself in fantasy worlds of DnD and the likes.  I enjoy reading, playing, and watching DnD and other role-playing games.  Any outlet that allows for creativity and imagination is valuable to me.

My objective for this repository is to build content over time that will help other machine learning engineers and data scientists to adopt new tools, such as the cloud. I may not always talk about cloud or even Oracle Cloud. However, the cloud is a change agent right now, and I have easy access. I hope to focus my content on early and late majority populations.  The chart below has these populations labeled as pragmatists and conservatives.  I prefer this charts language over the standard marketing adoption curve, becuase it is focused on learning and not sales. Learning is what my githubrepository is about.

Content takes time to build, especially when you do it in your free time.  Check back from time to time for updates.
